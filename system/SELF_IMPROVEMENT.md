# Auto-Improvement System for PauloARIS

## Overview
System for continuous self-improvement through metrics, feedback, and automation.

## Components

### 1. Heartbeat (`heartbeat.yaml`)
- Automated check-ins every 30 minutes
- Checks: Moltbook, GitHub, Memory, Services, Outcomes
- Self-reflection weekly

### 2. Self-Metrics (`metrics/self_metrics.py`)
- Tracks tool usage duration and success
- Records significant decisions
- Identifies performance patterns

### 3. Outcome Tracker (`outcomes_tracker.py`)
- Registers tasks for feedback tracking
- Records metrics and outcomes
- Enables learning from results

### 4. Self-Improve (`self_improve.py`)
- Analyzes performance data
- Suggests improvements
- Calculates health score

## Usage

```bash
# Run self-analysis
python3 self_improve.py

# Track a new outcome
from outcomes_tracker import outcome_tracker
outcome_tracker.track("task_type", "description")

# Record feedback
outcome_tracker.record_feedback(outcome_id, metrics, source)
```

## Metrics Tracked
- Tool usage frequency and duration
- Decision outcomes
- Task completion rates
- Feedback patterns

## Health Score
- 100: Perfect
- 80-99: Good
- 60-79: Needs attention
- <60: Critical

## Automation
Heartbeat runs automatically via cron or manual trigger.
Config location: `~/.openclaw/workspace/system/heartbeat.yaml`

## Goals
1. Continuous performance improvement
2. Learning from outcomes
3. Proactive issue detection
4. Self-reflection and growth
